Michael and I reviewed my commandFactory class. This class initializes an instance of a command objective depending on the token it receives. We concluded that it currently has a lot of duplicated code and this could be easily fixed by a combination of refactoring and implementing reflection. Furthermore, all types of commands are initialized from the same type of commandFactory. I am now considering creating separate commandFactories based on the type of command. However, I am still unsure of how each respective sub factory would create appropriate commands. For example, a boolean operation may need to compare two expressions that return integer values. I would like to separate math operations from boolean operations, but some of the details of how to do this remain unclear. 

For Michael's project, we discussed his implementation of the Observer interface and how best to pass objects to observable. We decided that it is okay to pass turtle objects as long as the turtle's are immutable i.e. cannot be changed by the observable class.
