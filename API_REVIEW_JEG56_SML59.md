###API REVIEW

We talked mainly about the frontend, and the interactions between the parser and the turtle.

We discussed the pros and cons of having the turtle directly interact with the parser as opposed to having a mediator between them, and ultimately decided that having a mediator was better in case the parser had to interact with objects of wildly differing type in the future (or multiple objects, etc). 

Also discussed was where the view information concerning the turtle should exist, in terms both of functions (where do the actual animation functions exist) and in terms of view-specific parameters (what color is the turtle's brush, how fast does it walk forward). A good way to store the variable information, we decided, was a resource file, as it is not related to the state of the turtle object but at the same time needs to be tied to it somehow. In terms of functions, the functions could then exist as some class called by the mediator, when the turtle tells it to (also passing in the necessary parameters obtained from the resource file). This way, the turtle doesn't have to know specifically how things are animated, but it can tell the client that it wants an animation to happen, and how fast it should happen. In addition, the animations (apart from parameters passed in) will be the same for every object. If different drawn objects need to be animated in ways that differ not just parametrically but functionally, then this will have to be refactored, but that would be a nightmare anyway because then every object needs a set of animation functions defined for it (that are view-related, not model-related, compounding the amount of code that has to be written). 

One substantial advantage of the mediator handling interaction between the parser and the turtle is that the parser can handle errors related specifically to parsing, while the mediator can handle errors related to a mismatch between functions or data the parser requests and functions or data the turtle actually possesses, meaning that neither the parser nor the turtle have to worry about whether their counterpart possesses the right functions. Only the mediator is in charge of matching up the needs of the two subapplications.
