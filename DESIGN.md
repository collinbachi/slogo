##Overview##

##User Interface##

The windows will be split into three main sections. First, there will be the workspace, an open square space where the turtle and other graphical elements are controlled and interacted with through code. Below this, will be a text box where the user can input raw ASCII text representing SLOGO commands and procedures. Next to it will be an execute button, that will consume the contents of the text box and pass them on to the parser.

The right side of the screen will be reserved for information display. The pane displayed will be controlled by selecting from several tabs at the top of the area. Available panes will include a reference of SLOGO commands, a reference of user/author defined SLOGO procedures, and a history of the user's inputted commands. 

The user will interact with the program primarily through the keyboard and text box. They will use the mouse or ENTER key to submit from the text box, and they will use the mouse to select which informational pane is currently displayed on the right side of the screen.
